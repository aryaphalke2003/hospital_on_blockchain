# Blockchain Project:

## Description
This website is a blockchain based Hopital Mangement system, which means it guarantees the zenith of security available in today's age.

Easy searching and sharing means that even amongst a million documents, it's a piece of cake finding a specific document. This website employs IPFS(Inter-Planetry File System) to store the clients' data in a safe encrypted format, reactt for the UI, the Ethereum blockchain to deploy the smart contracts.

## Features
- Metamask based authorisation and identity-management.
